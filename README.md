### REST Countries - Explore Countries Around the World

**Description:**
The **REST Countries** website is a dynamic and interactive web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to access detailed information about every country in the world, including data such as:

- **Country Name**
- **Capital City**
- **Area**
- **Currency**
- **Flag**
- **Languages Spoken**
- **Population**
- **Borders (Neighboring Countries)**
- **Region and Subregion**

The app fetches country data from the free **REST Countries API** and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface. Users can easily **search** for any country by name, and **filter** countries by **continent** or **subcontinent**. The application also provides a map of neighboring countries (border countries) for any selected country, making it an excellent tool for geography enthusiasts, travelers, and learners.

With this app, users can:
- **Search** for countries by name to quickly access their details.
- **Filter** countries by continent (e.g., Africa, Asia, Europe) or subcontinent (e.g., Southeast Asia, Western Europe).
- **View detailed country information** including flags, population statistics, and languages spoken.
- **Explore borders** by selecting a country and seeing which countries share a land border with it.
